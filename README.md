# Snippets
Code snippets should demonstrate best practices in C programming. For the most part, we inline our code in issues threads, but occassionally we'll surface bits that tend to be repeated in discussions, and the snippets repo is where we put that code, so we can just provide links to the latest version.

Eventually, we may chose to create seperate repo's for specific algorithms that will have various implementations on the time/space continuum, but there are already plenty of projects here on github that cover algorithms in C.
